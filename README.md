# Clinical Care Gap Dashboard

## Purpose of the Dashboard

This dashboard surfaces **clinical care gaps** and provides **patient-level insights** to healthcare stakeholders. It is designed to:

- Identify patients overdue for screenings or missing follow-ups
- Highlight candidates for clinical trials
- Enable ad hoc exploration of patient data

The platform promotes self-service analytics and operational visibility, aligning with best practices in healthcare data modeling and visualization.

### Overarching Goals

- Enable healthcare providers to **proactively intervene** in patient care
- Empower internal teams (e.g., product and account managers) to **investigate trends** without engineering help
- Improve **population health management** through cohort-level metrics
- Provide **transparent, interactive access** to clinical data via dbt and Looker

## Target Users

### 1. Clinical Analysts
- Track care compliance across demographics and diagnoses
- Filter patient populations by criteria such as age, condition, or encounter frequency

### 2. Account Managers
- Provide data-driven recommendations to support clinics and health systems
- Access patient-level and aggregated insights for strategic conversations

### 3. Product Managers
- Understand product impact and usage
- Identify feature gaps and prioritize enhancements

### 4. Healthcare Providers & Administrators
- Monitor quality metrics: time to follow-up, readmission rates, preventive care compliance
- Drill into clinical records for operational or medical decision-making

---

## Key Success Metrics

- Dashboard adoption (measured through usage logs or engagement)
- Reduction in simulated clinical care gaps (before/after analysis)
- Query performance and latency under real-world usage
- Growth in users building dashboards through Lookerâ€™s explore layer
- dbt model coverage (test success, documentation completeness, model reliability)

## Major Components

### 1. Data Modeling
- Normalize and clean synthetic EHR data (from [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea))
- Build foundational tables: `patients`, `conditions`, `procedures`, `encounters`
- Define derived models: 
  - `patients_with_care_gaps`
  - `trial_eligibility`
  - `screening_overdue`
- Use `dbt` for modular, versioned, and testable transformations

### 2. Visualization Layer
- Connect your data warehouse to **Looker** or **Looker Studio**
- Define LookML models and views for:
  - Patients
  - Care Gaps
  - Trial Readiness
- Build dashboards featuring:
  - Filters
  - Pivot tables
  - Scheduled alerts or reports

### 3. Documentation & Self-Service
- Write model and field-level documentation
- Create an ERD and Data Dictionary
- Enable non-technical users to perform their own data explorations in Looker

### 4. Custom Analysis & Use Cases
Support key workflows, including:
- Identifying patients eligible for trials
- Surfacing patients overdue for screenings
- Filtering by chronic conditions or encounter history
